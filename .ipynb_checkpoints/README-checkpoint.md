# My_implementation_of_common_algorithms

This repo contaions of my implementations of several machine learning algorithms, including:

- K-Nearest_Neighbor
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boost
- AdaBoost

For every algorithms mentioned above, my implementation managed to match the estimators in scikit-learn package on some toy datasets.
